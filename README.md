## Contributing Guidelines

If working on code:

- You must use a formatter that uses our `.editorconfig`
- `.cs` files must be in Pascal Case, e.g. `MyCustomScript.cs`
- Variable names in `.cs` files must be in Camel Case, e.g. `myVariable`, except constants, these must be in Pascal Case
- Variable names must have a meaningful name and must not be an abbreviation, e.g. no `initialSecs` but rather `initialSeconds`
- Private variables must start with an underscore
- Curly braces must be on new line
- Use Godot Resources when necessary
- Use the export feature so non-developers can also change relevant data in the editor, e.g. `[Export]`
- Log/Print Statements must be meaningful, e.g. no `GD.Print("Error in script")`
- Method Names must be in Pascal Case
- Node names must be in PascalCase. Godot Nodes are also in this naming convention so it makes sense
